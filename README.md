Shopify Collection Page

## Tech Stack used
* HTML
* CSS
* Javascript
* Bootstrap 4

## Project Setup Guidelines
A simple Javascript shooping cart page designed with BootStrap 4, index.html is the entry point which loads all the required resources into the window and initiates the app.

## Feedback/Comments on the Project
My approach with this application is identifying the pieces of code that can be reused in the page and use them as components and write modular functions easy to debug and understand. I made sure the lines of code in a function is not more than 10 lines unless it is a component with html code. This application could have been even simpler if an advanced tech stack like React and Material UI is used but due to hardware constraints at the moment I'm facing, couldn't use it. I like the way StoreFrontAPI is developed and several API methods been exposed without having to write a service layer for API requests, like the design, it is simple yet elegant.

## Estimated Time for completion
It took me around 20 hrs approx. in total to develop and design the way it looks now.

## Pending
Pagination, color/size variant selections, checkout is partially implemented as it was the last thing I worked on and didn't had much time to explore the checkout resource feature of API.   

## Further Improvements in mind
* A model to store and handle data received from API which enables plugin and plug off properties that are deprecated, provides abstraction and security.
